104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/
Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        if(!root) return 0;
        return 1+max(maxDepth(root->left),maxDepth(root->right));
    }
};
