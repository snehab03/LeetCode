543. Diameter of Binary Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/description/

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

    int f(TreeNode* root,int& dia){

        int r=f(root->right,dia);
        dia=max(dia,l+r);
        return 1+max(l,r);
    }

        int dia=0;
